# Password Generator

## Description

Developed JS code that produces a strong password based on user input for character length, as well as whether the user wants the inclusion of numbers, symbols, and/or letter cases.

## Github

Due to several issues with the original Github repository, a new repo was created. As a result, the commits that were previously made in the old repo may not show up in the new one.
